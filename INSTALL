Basic Installation
==================

1. Windows
==========

To build the KhunPhan executable on Windows Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 is
needed. The khunphan project supports all combinations of Debug/Release, 
Win32/x64.

For successfull compiling and linking KhunPhan the following
libraries (incl. headers) are necessary:

   libxml2       (http://xmlsoft.org)
   libiconv      (https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/)
   libpng        (http://www.libpng.org)
   zlib          (http://zlib.net/)
   libSDL2       (http://www.libsdl.org)
   libSDL2_mixer (http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
   freeglut      (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)
   glew          (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

   The whole build process is supported by two shell scripts. They can be
   executed on git bash.

   1. download_and_rebuild_libs.sh Downloads all packages and rebuilds them
      for all supported platforms and configurations. The result can be found
      in subdirectory build/windows/lib.
   2. rebuild_all_and_copy_libs.sh Rebuilds khunphan for all supported
      configurations and platforms and copies the previously created DLLs into
      the build directory.

   As a result khunphan can be executed directly from within Visual Studio
   debugger.

   Step by step build and installation:

   1. Download wget from
      https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/Other/mingwPORT/Current%20Release/
      Copy wget.exe into the git installation mingw64/bin or mingw32/bin.

   2. Open a git bash shell in folder build/windows

   3. Execute download_and_rebuild_libs.sh, all packages for dependent DLLs
      are downloaded, extracted and build for all combinations of Win32, x64,
      Debug and Release.

   4. Execute rebuild_all_and_copy_libs.sh, rebuilds khunphan for all 
      combinations of Win32, x64, Debug and Release. The dependent DLLs 
      are copied to the corresponding target directory.

   5. Creating a desktop icon
      Use the absolute path to khunphan.exe as executable path
      Use the khunphan src directory as working directory

2. Linux
========

In short:
---------

   ./configure
   make
   make install

   (make install-strip to strip debug information from the binary file)

   Needed libraries for the installation:

   libxml2      (http://xmlsoft.org)
   libiconv     (https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/)
   libpng       (http://www.libpng.org)
   zlib         (http://zlib.net/)
   libSDL       (http://www.libsdl.org) (SDL1.2 or SDL2)
   libSDL_mixer (http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) (SDL_mixer 1.2 or 2.0)
   freeglut     (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) is optional

   Either install them from a source distribution or by the package
   manager of your Linux distribution. Don't forget to also install
   the -dev/-devel package.

   SuSE Distribution packages:

   libxml2-x.y.z.rpm/libxml2-devel.x.y.z.rpm)

More detailed:
--------------

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.

3. Add a new language
=====================
In KhunPhan any language supporting ISO 8859-1 character set can easily be 
added with two steps. No recompilation is needed.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1 shows all supported characters.

1. Make a new entry in file locale/999.lang with the next unused language id.
   e.g.:   902 Fran√ais

2. Copy file 900.lang to a file 9xy.lang. Use the same id as in step 1.
   Open the file and translate all strings to the target language.
