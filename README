1. Introduction

KhunPhan is a strategic puzzle game. Goal of the game is to
move the biggest token to a specific position. For
beginners  a tutorial and solution hint is available. The
game is visible as a 3-dimensional model with different
camera positions, all movements including the menus are
physically calculated.

Different themes like wood, rock, metal, marble, bubbles or
painting are available. They both influence the display and
the sound effects. Ambient and Drum & Bass music from
Nicklas Nygren (https://nifflas.ni2.se/) give the game a unique
athmosphere.

The idea for this game came from a little wooden box
containing this game I bought on a bazar in Thailand.
